find in my online resume and portfolio What a good story indeed  but for a fairly long texts website or is it the intention that each text is a separate site will be created How could you both texts insite bring together the idea that I attended was this text people show presentations If you and Fred now consider each text to convey inspiring convincing and the camera so we make two movies we put on a website and on YouTube So keep your attention easier for sun long story effectively fixed Simply An arresting headline above and one to a page with the full text underneath Another image I there get is climbing a mountain vs  descending the mountain Everyone must come to the summit pushed purpose hard way or you go down and you can see all sides of your flows and is naturally followed Well I do not know how you can imagine but the movies I see are really Maybe you can use the metaphor in the sun video If necessary you going to tell me the story while the camera is running Ok glad it

Edin logootje on your site I thought  you can also use an existing page on your site duplicate edit and publish later when he s done then you can the original page off and possibly in due course when

not you Or maybe you can learn Lars because I have enough other projects where I need to work You just need to download the current agenda and keep a copy Well see how it fits together because it comes quite close and it s not all as logical ie if you do it differently then some whitespace between the text where you do not want and they disappear where you want them or you have here and there
