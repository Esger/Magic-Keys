# Magic-Keys
A keyboard (js prototype) for touch devices with less keys that always offers the most probably needed key subset for your next keystroke.
It shows only half of the alphabet. The other half can be reached with a modifier key (green arrow ->).
Numbers and other characters can also be reached by pressing a modifier key like shift or numlock.
It learns and performs better when you use it more. It adapts to your vocabulary, while it doesn't use a vocabulary.
It's algorithm is based on statistics; it just counts how often a certain character is followed by another character. Thus it decides which characters to offer next. While doing this it takes in account that characters shouldn't jump around on the keyboard too much. This is a point that is succeptible to enhancements though.
